Empathy measures a character's ability to identify other people's emotions and feelings. They may use this to take advantage of someone, feign sympathy, or form a genuine connection. A particularly successful empathy roll may even identify a lie. A highly empathetic character will need to be on guard, as they may be so caught up in another's feelings that their own may be affected.
